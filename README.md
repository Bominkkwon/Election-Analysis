## Technologies
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Download Python")

## Overview 
The dataset,[election_results.csv](https://github.com/Bominkkwon/Election-Analysis/tree/main/Resources "Resources/eletion_results.csv), that is given for this project consists of a number for the ballot ID and a name for the county and candidate, respectively. In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver the following information when the script is run to complete the audit: 
* Total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* Total number of votes each candidate received
* Percentage of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote
* The voter turnout for each county
* The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
* The county with the highest turnout
